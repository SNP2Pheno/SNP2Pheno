## SNP2Pheno
Study Project MBI 2025

This program is part of a study project within the MBI degree program at the University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria, Hagenberg Campus. The project's objective is to analyze an individual's genotype — specifically, known SNPs within their genetic sequence — to infer phenotypic traits. The ultimate goal is to generate a probabilistic facial reconstruction based on genetic markers, provide an overview of potential disease risks, and estimate the individual's likely ancestral origins.
