## SNP2Pheno
Study Project MBI 2025

This program is part of a study project within the MBI degree program at the University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria, Hagenberg Campus. The project's objective is to analyze an individual's genotype - specifically, known SNPs within their genetic sequence - to infer phenotypic traits. The ultimate goal is to generate a probabilistic facial reconstruction based on genetic markers and estimate the individual's likely ancestral origins.
